# GeoPredictor

**GeoPredictor** is an Earthquake Prediction Model using Machine Learning. The project leverages historical earthquake data to predict the magnitude of future earthquakes based on various geographical features such as latitude, longitude, depth, and distance to the Ring of Fire. The project also includes visualization techniques to better understand the data and model performance.
